# Naive Bayes Basketball Classifier/Predictor
---

## Overview
This project implements a **Naive Bayes Classifier** to predict basketball outcomes (e.g., win/loss, player performance, or game features) based on historical game data. The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that all input features are conditionally independent, making it computationally efficient and interpretable.

## Key Features
1. **Input Data**: Basketball stats and game features (e.g., player points, assists, rebounds).
2. **Classifier**: A probabilistic model trained using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm.
3. **Prediction**: Predict outcomes such as:
   - Match result: Win or Loss
   - Player performance: Good, Average, or Poor
4. **Evaluation**: Model accuracy using appropriate metrics.
